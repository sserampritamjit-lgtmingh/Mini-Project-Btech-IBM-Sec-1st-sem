/* Problem Title: The Farmer’s Fencing Problem
 Problem Story:
A farmer named Raju owns a rectangular piece of land.
He wants to build a fence around it and also plant crops inside the land.

To plan the fencing and crop area, he needs to calculate:

The area of the rectangle (for crops).

The perimeter of the rectangle (for fencing).

He knows the length and width of the land in meters.
Can you help Raju write a program to find both the area and perimeter of his land?

 Task:
Write a program that takes two integers as input — the length and width of the rectangle —
and prints the area and perimeter.

 Input Format:
The first line contains two integers,
length and width — dimensions of the rectangle.

 Output Format:
Print two lines:

First line: "Area = <value>"

Second line: "Perimeter = <value>"*/


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int l,b;
	int area,perimeter;
	
	cout<<"Enter length of the rectangle:";
	cin>>l;
	cout<<"Enter width of the rectangle:";
	cin>>b;
	
	area= l*b;
	perimeter= 2*(l+b);
	
	cout<<"Area = "<<area<<endl;
	cout<<"Perimeter = "<<perimeter<<endl;
	
	return 0;
}
