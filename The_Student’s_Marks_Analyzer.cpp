/*Question: The Student’s Marks Analyzer

?? Problem Story:
A teacher wants to analyze the marks of her students in a test.
She asks you to write a program that stores the marks of n students and finds out:

The total marks obtained by all students.

The average marks of the class.

Can you help the teacher by writing the program?
Task:

Write a program that takes the number of students and their marks as input and calculates:

The total marks

The average marks

Input Format:

The first line contains one integer n — number of students.

The next line contains n integers — marks of each student.

?? Output Format:

Print two lines:

First line: "Total Marks = <value>"

Second line: "Average Marks = <value>"
Example 1:

Input:
5
80 70 90 85 75

Output:
Total Marks = 400
Average Marks = 80.00*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
	int n,marks,total;
	
	cout<<"Enter total no. of students: ";
	cin>>n;
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++){
		
	cout<<"Enter marks of student "<<i<<"(out of 100)= ";
	cin>>marks;
	total+=marks;
	
	}
	double average=total/n;
	cout<<"Total marks = "<<total<<endl;
	cout<<"Average marks = "<<average<<endl;
	return 0;
