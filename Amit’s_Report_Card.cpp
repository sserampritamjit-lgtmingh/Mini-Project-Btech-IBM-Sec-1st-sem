Write a program to read the marks of n subjects and print the highest and lowest marks.

?? Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — the number of subjects.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing Amit’s marks.

Output Format:

Print two lines in the following format:

Highest = maximum_marks
Lowest = minimum_marks
