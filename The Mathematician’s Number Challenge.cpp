/*Problem Title: The Mathematician’s Number Challenge

Problem Story:
Riya, a young mathematician, loves playing with numbers. One day, she picks a number and wants to check two things:

Whether the number is prime or not.

Whether it is even or odd.
She wants your help to write a program that tells her both answers.
Task:
Write a program that takes an integer as input and:

Checks if it is a prime number or not.

Checks whether it is even or odd.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer — the number to check.

Output Format:
Print two lines:
First line: "Prime Number" or "Not Prime"
Second line: "Even Number" or "Odd Number"


Example 1:
Input: 7
Output:
Prime Number
Odd Number

Example 2:
Input: 10
Output:
Not Prime
Even Number*/
