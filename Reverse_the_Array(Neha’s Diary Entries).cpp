/*Problem 1: Reverse the Array (Neha’s Diary Entries)
?? Problem Story:

Neha keeps a diary of her daily exercise times (in minutes).
She wants to review her progress, but she prefers to see the latest day’s record first.

Write a program to help Neha reverse the order of her recorded exercise times.

? Task:

Given n numbers representing Neha’s daily exercise time, print them in reverse order.

?? Input Format:

The first line contains an integer n — the number of days.

The second line contains n space-separated integers representing exercise times.
Output Format:

Print the exercise times in reverse order on a single line separated by spaces.

?? Example 1:

Input
5
10 20 30 40 50

Output
50 40 30 20 10*/


#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int n;
    cout << "Enter number of days: ";
    cin >> n;               
    int arr[n];

    cout << "Enter exercise time for each day (in minutes): ";

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        cin >> arr[i];
    }

    cout << "\nExercise times in reverse order: ";

    for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
        cout << arr[i];
        if (i > 0) cout << " "; 
    }

    return 0;
}
